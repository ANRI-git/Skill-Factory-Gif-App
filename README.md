# *Skill Factory* Bootcamp
Welcome to my GitHub repository for *Avalith's bootcamp* named **Skill Factory** divided in two courses, one for React and other for Node. Here you will find my very first projects made in React and Node.js.
## *Gif App* page
First *Front-end* project made in **React** and **Node.js**. 
It's a minimalistic GIF search page. Its main functionality is to search any GIF that you want, connecting the page directly to the **Giphy Developers API**.
## Testing on *Gif App*
Second project for Skill Factory's **React** course.
The test folder contains the unit and integrative testing files on almost every component of the App. I used **testing Library** and **Jest**.
